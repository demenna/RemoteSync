      <![CDATA[
<p>Nicely illustrated post by David Barnard on retina display Macs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The point is, PPI is much less relevant on OS X than on iOS. To
create Retina displays, Apple doesn&#8217;t have to build displays that
are exactly 2X current displays, they just have to build displays
that work well with OS X when running @2X. For example, the
current 27-inch iMac is 2560 by 1440 pixels, which translates to
109ppi. Doubling that to 5120 by 2880 pixels is not strictly
necessary. Such a screen might be incredibly difficult to
manufacture, and therefore incredibly expensive. Instead, Apple
<em>could</em> build a 3840 by 2400 pixel 27-inch screen that presented
itself as a pixel doubled 1920 by 1200 pixel display. That’s
effectively an 84ppi screen @1X and 168ppi screen @2X.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The key thing to keep in mind is that on iOS, the precise physical size of screen elements matters. A button rendered on an iPhone 4 uses four times the pixels as the same button rendered on an iPhone 3GS &#8212; but they&#8217;re the exact same size. That&#8217;s not a concern with the Mac, because the Mac is not a touchscreen device &#8212; and I don&#8217;t think it ever will be.</p>

      <![CDATA[
<p>Phil Goldstein, in a report for FierceWireless headlined &#8220;Motorola Exec: Product Strategy Won&#8217;t Change After Google Acquisition&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alain Mutricy, Motorola&#8217;s senior vice president of portfolio and
product management, told FierceWireless in an interview here at
Mobile World Congress that Motorola will not alter its plans once
it comes under the Google &#8220;umbrella.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This echoes Andy Rubin&#8217;s recent remarks from a few days prior, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/27/2827692/google-building-firewall-between-android-and-motorola-after">as quoted by The Verge</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google&#8217;s Andy Rubin led the charge to acquire Motorola, but the
Android boss won&#8217;t have anything to do with the company once the
deal closes &#8212; he told reporters at Mobile World Congress today
that he &#8220;sponsored&#8221; the acquisition but now has &#8220;nothing to do
with it&#8230;. I don&#8217;t even know who&#8217;s running it.&#8221; […] Rubin said he
was &#8220;painfully aware&#8221; of concerns, but stressed that Google has
&#8220;literally built a firewall&#8221; between the Android team and
Motorola. &#8220;I don&#8217;t even know anything about their products, I
haven&#8217;t seen anything,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re going to continue
building Motorola branded devices and it&#8217;s going to be the same
team doing it.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(The same team <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/23/2819482/dennis-woodside-to-replace-sanjay-jha-as-motorola-mobility-ceo">minus CEO Sanjay Jha</a>, that is.)</p>

<p>Does anyone actually buy this? It&#8217;d be one thing if Motorola were doing well, or even if they were merely doing OK, but they&#8217;re not &#8212; they&#8217;re doing terribly. <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/02/03/first-apples-rank-in-mobile-phone-profitability-and-revenues/">They&#8217;re losing money and are generating little revenue</a>. What sense does it make for Motorola to stay the course? Larry Page is just going to say, &#8220;Welcome to Google, you guys just keep doing what you&#8217;ve been doing &#8212; losing money and making phones that don&#8217;t sell very well&#8221;?</p>

<p>I presume Google and Motorola executives are saying these things to assuage the fears of Motorola&#8217;s rival Android handset makers. But do any of them believe it?</p>

<p>Eric Grevstad, writing for PC Mag:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That&#8217;s because, for all the talk about whether the iPad 3 will
have a quad-core processor or a retina display or a VW Beetle bud
vase, we already know one thing about it: It won&#8217;t be a laptop.
And we know, if we&#8217;re honest, that the iPad is no substitute for a
laptop. Never will be. Isn&#8217;t supposed to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, out in the real world, every time I go into a coffee shop or airport, I see people using iPads for things which previously required a laptop. That the iPad is not a substitute for a laptop for <em>everyone</em> does not mean it is not a substitute for <em>anyone</em>. That&#8217;s the key to the iPad&#8217;s success. Many people don&#8217;t need a laptop for their away-from-the-desk computing needs.</p>

      <![CDATA[
<p>New promotional page from Apple touting the jobs the company has created, including over 200,000 jobs in what they&#8217;re calling the &#8220;app economy&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With more than 550,000 apps and more than 24 billion downloads in
less than four years, the App Store has created an entirely new
industry: iOS app design and development. The app revolution has
added more than 210,000 iOS jobs to the U.S. economy since the
introduction of iPhone in 2007. And Apple has paid more than $4
billion in royalties to developers through the App Store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While many companies locate their technical support call centers
overseas to save money, we’ve decided to keep our call centers in
the U.S. The vast majority of our customer support calls are
handled by U.S. employees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What prompted this? I&#8217;m guessing it was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?pagewanted=all">the first piece in the New York Times&#8217;s &#8220;iEconomy&#8221; series</a>, which focused on manufacturing jobs that have gone to Asia, and made the case that engineering and support jobs tend to follow manufacturing jobs overseas. Not so with Apple.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em>* The bit about creating jobs at Corning implicitly confirms that Apple is using Gorilla Glass in at least some of its products &#8212; presumably the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad.</p>

<p>Mathew Ingram on the e-book landscape:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we’ve described before, Apple and Amazon come at the e-book
market from different perspectives: Apple sees books as just
another form of content that it can use to sell iPads and other
devices, whereas Amazon sees devices like the Kindle and the
Kindle Fire as ways it can lock people into its content ecosystem
and sell them more books, movies and so on. But both are dependent
on having users locked into their products, and so they make it as
difficult as possible to move from one to the other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is pretty much why I was so <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/11/dum">down on DRM e-books</a> all along, and why <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/02/23/carr-ebooks">I like Nick Carr&#8217;s idea</a> to bundle e-books as downloads <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2012/01/why_publishers.php">that accompany good old-fashioned printed books</a>.</p>

  <p>To the average user, the two new security technologies coming to
OS X this year &#8212; sandboxing and Gatekeeper &#8212; should be virtually
invisible. But they could be all too visible to more advanced
users, particularly those who use AppleScript and Automator.</p>

  <p>Google TV comes with a number of pre-installed apps, which are
also listed on the Android Market. One example of this is the TV
and Movies app, which is basically Google TV’s programming guide
&#8212; an essential part of the Google TV experience that most users
wouldn’t dare to delete from their machines. The active install
base for this app, according to Google’s Android Market, currently
is 500,000 to 1 million. The same is true for all the other apps
that come pre-installed with Google TV, which suggests that the
number of Google TV devices that are currently being used by
consumers is less than 1 million.</p>

  <p>Clearly, a hypothetical customer who purchases <em>Stop Stealing
Dreams</em> from the iBookstore 1) prefers (or at least enjoys) ebooks
and 2) has chosen Apple&#8217;s offering over utilizing the freely
available Kindle app. Common sense, then, says you cater to that
customer&#8217;s established preference, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Opinions on this (and regarding my take on it) are all over the map. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/CashGap/status/175241692469923840">Some</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/KeriHenare/status/175076962409267201">agree</a>, but a <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/maccouch/status/175234552330067968">bunch</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/tomstuart/status/175139673440657408">of</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/johnallsopp/status/175076193710776320">others</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ryanisinallofus/status/175285365177974784">see</a> Apple&#8217;s decision as blatant censorship. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/GlennF/status/175276165982990337">Glenn Fleishman tweets</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@gruber I don&#8217;t buy the iBookstore/B&amp;N equivalency. Apple is
asking for books to be changed b/c content doesn&#8217;t accord
w/commercial policy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are other problems with my analogy <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/02/29/godin-ibooks">yesterday</a> to a brick-and-mortar bookstore not wanting to carry a book that contained coupons for buying books in a competitor&#8217;s store. Links to Amazon from an iBooks book are more like teleporting you into the competing store. And e-book stores are stores you never really leave &#8212; so long as you have a network connection, you&#8217;re never more than a tap or two away from the store. I don&#8217;t think Apple needs to sweat over links to Amazon.</p>

<p>Also, for those criticizing my take yesterday: I didn&#8217;t say I agreed with Apple&#8217;s decision. I simply pointed out the ways how I could see where they were coming from. I still don&#8217;t see this as over-the-line censorship, but I don&#8217;t think Apple should concern itself with links to Amazon. My recommendation would have been for Apple to suggest to Godin that he change the links to point to iBookstore versions of the books, but if Godin didn&#8217;t want to, to let it slide.</p>

<p>Speaking of Abdel Ibrahim, I&#8217;ve been meaning to link to his detailed comparison of the Olloclip and iPro Lens camera attachments for the iPhone 4 and 4S:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s no question that the iPro Lens takes better pictures, and
its handle gives it a leg up on videos, too. The Olloclip, on the
other hand, comes in a much smaller, more convenient package that
outshined the iPro when I was on the go.</p>

<p>Abdel Ibrahim and Jon Dick, writing for The Tech Block:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Samsung made its latest Galaxy Tab pitch, for instance,
instead of giving consumers reason to overlook the rest of the <a href="http://www.thetechblock.com/articles/2012/samsung-pinning-its-tablet-hopes-on-galaxy-note/">Tab
family’s disappointing performance</a>, the company overshadowed the
tablet’s 7.7-inch, LTE credentials with this fuckup: The Galaxy
tab 7.7 will set you back a minimum $499, and that’s <em>with</em> a 2-year
contract. If you say to hell with carriers, the price of the puny
tablet swells to an eye-watering, deal-breaking $699.</p>

<p>And Sony, <a href="http://kotaku.com/5881530/sony-is-bleeding-money">already bleeding money</a>, is similarly stupid. Its Tablet
P, a 5.5-inch tablet with a Nintendo DS-like ability to fold in
half, will price itself off the market with a 399-dollar contract
tag, and that price skyrockets to $549 without a contract.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps Sony and Samsung aren&#8217;t stupid, though. Perhaps they simply can&#8217;t afford to sell these tablets for less. Don&#8217;t underestimate Apple&#8217;s supply chain and economy-of-scale advantages. (But if that&#8217;s the case, one could argue they&#8217;re stupid for even trying. If you can&#8217;t make something at a competitive price, why make it?)</p>

<p>But these guys are right that these prices seem like non-starters. The iPad is better, bigger, has more apps and better apps, and is cheaper. The fact that these tablets are only price competitive with the iPad when they&#8217;re bought with a two-year contract is a killer. People aren&#8217;t stupid. People hate contracts.</p>

<p>Seth Godin:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I just found out that Apple is rejecting my new manifesto <em><a href="http://www.squidoo.com/stop-stealing-dreams">Stop
Stealing Dreams</a></em> and won’t carry it in their store because
inside the manifesto are links to buy the books I mention in the
bibliography.</p>

<p>Quoting here from their note to me, rejecting the book: “Multiple
links to Amazon store. IE page 35, David Weinberger link.”</p>

<p>And there’s the conflict. We’re heading to a world where there are
just a handful of influential bookstores (Amazon, Apple, Nook…)
and one by one, the principles of open access are disappearing.
<em>Apple, apparently, won’t carry an ebook that contains a link to
buy a hardcover book from Amazon.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Would Amazon carry a book that linked each book in the bibliography to the iBookstore? I don&#8217;t know, maybe they would. But would Barnes &amp; Noble carry a book that contained coupons to buy additional books at Borders? (Pretend Borders is still in business.) Why not link to iBookstore versions of the books from the iBooks edition?</p>

<p>Keep in mind that Apple <a href="https://twitter.com/fraserspeirs/status/174964066475970561">isn&#8217;t blocking Godin&#8217;s book from being read in iBooks</a> &#8212; they&#8217;re simply not selling it in their e-book store.</p>

<p>Mark Jeftovic, writing on the EasyDNS blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But at the end of the day what has happened is that US law (in
fact, Maryland state law) as been imposed on a .com domain
operating outside the USA, which is the subtext we were very
worried about <a href="http://blog.easydns.org/2011/12/22/how-sopa-will-destroy-the-internet/">when we commented on SOPA</a>. Even though SOPA is
currently in limbo, the reality that US law can now be asserted
over all domains registered under .com, .net, org, .biz and
maybe .info (Afilias is headquartered in Ireland by operates out
of the US).</p>

<p>This is no longer a doom-and-gloom theory by some guy in a tin
foil hat. It just happened.</p>

      <![CDATA[
<p>From NPR&#8217;s new Ethics Handbook:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At all times, we report for our readers and listeners, not our
sources. So our primary consideration when presenting the news is
that we are fair to the truth. If our sources try to mislead us or
put a false spin on the information they give us, we tell our
audience. If the balance of evidence in a matter of controversy
weighs heavily on one side, we acknowledge it in our reports. We
strive to give our audience confidence that all sides have been
considered and represented fairly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://pressthink.org/2012/02/npr-tries-to-get-its-pressthink-right/">Jay Rosen</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With these words, NPR commits itself as an organization to avoid
the worst excesses of “<a href="http://archive.pressthink.org/2009/04/12/hesaid_shesaid.html">he said, she said</a>” journalism. It says to
itself that a report characterized by false balance is a false
report. It introduces a new and potentially powerful concept of
fairness: being “fair to the truth,” which as we know is not
always evenly distributed among the sides in a public dispute.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The past two months have been unprecedented; there has never been
anything like it at the company,” said Danny Sullivan, editor in
chief of the blog Search Engine Land, who has closely covered
Google since the company began. “They are a big company, and any
big company is always going to have something happen that they
don’t expect. But these things keep happening where you can’t even
trust their word.”</p>

<p>When I asked Mr. Sullivan if Google was now too big not to be
evil, he said, “I don’t think they were ever not evil.”</p>

<p>Google says nothing has changed.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>What I detect in Google&#8217;s behavior (and John Battelle&#8217;s more-or-less defense of it) is a sense of entitlement. That because in the past ad networks could track almost all users via cookies, they are entitled to continue tracking almost all users across the web via cookies, even when a large (and growing) number of them begin using a web browser which, by default, tries to prevent it.</p>
]]>
</summary>
    <content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en">
      <![CDATA[
<p>A week ago, John Battelle wrote a curious response to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204880404577225380456599176.html?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories">this Wall Street Journal report</a> about Google circumventing Safari&#8217;s (and, notably, Mobile Safari&#8217;s) default setting only to accept cookies from visited websites.</p>

<p>Long story short: Web <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">cookies</a> are small bits of saved data that websites can store in your browser. Cookies are restricted by domain; if example.com stores a cookie in your browser, the only website your browser sends that cookie back to is example.com. But, by default, most desktop web browsers allow &#8220;third-party&#8221; cookies. That means if a page on <em>example.com</em> loads JavaScript from a different domain, that JavaScript is able to use cookies too. One common use is by ad networks; an ad network can set a cookie and then access that same cookie from any website that uses the same ad network. Google makes use of such cookies to display its ads. Ad networks that use cookies in this manner do so in order to track users across websites.</p>

<p>All major browsers give the user control over cookie permissions. Usually, with three options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accept cookies from anywhere (i.e., allow third-party cookies)</li>
<li>Accept cookies only from visited websites (disallow third-party cookies)</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t accept any cookies at all</li>
</ul>

<p>The difference with Safari is in the default for this setting. Most major browsers default to the first option, allowing all cookies. Safari and Mobile Safari default to the second, allowing only first-party cookies.</p>

<p>What the WSJ discovered is that Google (and a few other ad networks) found a way to store third-party cookies in Safari and Mobile Safari even when the option was set only to accept cookies from visited websites, as it is by default.</p>

<p>That brings us to Battelle&#8217;s response, &#8220;<a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/2012/02/a-sad-state-of-internet-affairs-the-journal-on-google-apple-and-privacy.php">A Sad State of Internet Affairs: The Journal on Google, Apple, and &#8216;Privacy&#8217;</a>&#8221;. (Background information: Battelle is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Search-Rewrote-Business-Transformed-Culture/dp/1591840880">an expert on Google</a>, and is the founder and executive chair of <a href="http://www.federatedmedia.net/">Federated Media</a>, an ad network.)</p>

<p>Battelle writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s the lead in the Journal’s story, which requires a
login/registration:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Google Inc. and other advertising companies have been bypassing
the privacy settings of millions of people using Apple Inc.’s Web
browser on their iPhones and computers &#8212; tracking the
Web-browsing habits of people who intended for that kind of
monitoring to be blocked.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, from what I can tell, the first part of that story is true &#8212;
Google and many others have figured out ways to get around Apple’s
default settings on Safari in iOS &#8212; the only browser that comes
with iOS, a browser that, in my experience, has never asked me
what kind of privacy settings I wanted, nor did it ask if I wanted
to share my data with anyone else (I do, it turns out, for any
number of perfectly good reasons).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Battelle has a good point here, which is that the Journal&#8217;s use of &#8220;intended&#8221; is too broad a stroke. <em>Some</em> Safari users have deliberately specified their cookie privacy settings, but most (and I&#8217;d wager nearly all) have never changed the default, and don&#8217;t even know what cookies are. But that&#8217;s true for users of all browsers, not just Safari. And it&#8217;s true for all settings, not just cookie preferences. <em>Most users don&#8217;t change settings and just use the defaults.</em> Default settings are incredibly important.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t recall any browser prompting me about cookie privacy settings before using it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple assumes that I agree with Apple’s point of view on
“privacy,” which, I must say, is ridiculous on its face, because
the idea of a large corporation (Apple is the largest, in fact)
determining in advance what I might want to do with my data is
pretty much the opposite of “privacy.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The difference with Safari isn&#8217;t that Apple has made <em>an</em> assumption about the user&#8217;s view regarding cookie privacy; it&#8217;s that Apple has made a <em>different</em> assumption than that made by other browser vendors.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then again, Apple decided I hated Flash, too, so I shouldn’t be
that surprised, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Deciding that iOS would be better without Flash is not the same thing as deciding that all iOS users &#8220;hate&#8221; Flash.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In short, Apple’s mobile version of Safari broke with common web
practice, and as a result, it broke Google’s normal approach to
engaging with consumers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d have used &#8220;tracking&#8221; in place of &#8220;engaging with&#8221;, but that&#8217;s semantics. My quibble is with the notion that Safari &#8220;broke with common web practice&#8221;. All major browsers have an option to block third-party cookies. And I&#8217;ll bet Safari is not the first to block them by default. What&#8217;s new is that Safari (a) blocks third-party cookies by default, and (b) is popular and growing (particularly in mobile).</p>

<p>Safari hasn&#8217;t broken the web; it has simply broken the heretofore safe assumption that an overwhelming majority of web surfers accepted third-party cookies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Was Google’s “normal approach” wrong? Well, I suppose that’s a
debate worth having &#8212; it’s currently standard practice and the
backbone of the entire web advertising ecosystem &#8212; but the
Journal doesn’t bother to go into those details. One can debate
whether setting cookies should happen by default &#8212; but the fact
is, that’s how it’s done on the open web.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, I think Battelle falls off the rails. No one is criticizing Google for using third-party tracking cookies in general. No one. What&#8217;s being criticized is Google devising and implementing a method to store third-party cookies in web browsers which are set not to accept third-party cookies. It didn&#8217;t happen by accident. Google wrote code specifically to circumvent this setting in Safari.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Journal article does later acknowledge, though not in a way
that a reasonable reader would interpret as meaningful, that the
mobile version of Safari has “default” (ie not user activated)
settings that prevent Google and others (like ad giant WPP) to
track user behavior the way they do on the “normal” Web. That’s a
far cry from the Journal’s lead paragraph, which again, states
Google bypassed the “the privacy settings of millions of people.”
So when is a privacy setting really a privacy setting, I wonder?
When Apple makes it so?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again: we&#8217;re all in agreement here that this is a dispute about <em>default</em> settings, not which settings are available for user tweaking. So let&#8217;s concede that Battelle has a point that Google didn&#8217;t bypass the privacy settings of millions of <em>people</em> so much as they bypassed the privacy settings of millions of <em>web browsers</em>. What Battelle is implicitly arguing here is that it&#8217;s OK &#8212; or at least not so bad &#8212; for Google to bypass browser privacy settings if most users didn&#8217;t specify those settings manually. (There&#8217;s no way for Google to tell which Safari users block third-party cookies simply by default and which ones block them because they understand what&#8217;s going on and have made an explicit choice.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since this story has broken, Google has discontinued its practice,
making it look even worse, of course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d argue that Google would look worse if they had continued the practice, even after it had been publicized.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But let’s step back a second here and ask: why do you think Apple
has made it impossible for advertising-driven companies like
Google to execute what are industry standard practices on the open
web (dropping cookies and tracking behavior so as to provide
relevant services and advertising)? Do you think it’s because
Apple cares deeply about your privacy?</p>

<p>Really?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But they haven&#8217;t made it impossible. They&#8217;ve only changed the <em>default</em>. But the truth is the default setting is all that matters to Google and other immense ad networks, because what matters to them is aggregate user tracking, not individual user tracking.<sup id="fnr1-2012-02-24"><a href="#fn1-2012-02-24">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I certainly can&#8217;t prove that Apple specified this default setting for the sake of user privacy, rather than out of competitive spite against Google.<sup id="fnr2-2012-02-24"><a href="#fn2-2012-02-24">2</a></sup> But I&#8217;m thinking that if you took a thousand random iOS and Mac users, sat them down and explained to them in layman&#8217;s terms what browser cookies are and how Google uses them to track their behavior across the web, and then conducted a survey among them as to what Safari&#8217;s default cookie privacy setting should be, we&#8217;d find out that Apple chose well to break with tradition here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this case, what Google and others have done sure sounds wrong
&#8212; if you’ve going to resort to tricking a browser into offering
up information designated by default as private, you need to
somehow message the user and explain what’s going on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Sounds</em> wrong, or <em>is</em> wrong?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then again, in the open web, you don’t have to &#8212; most browsers
let you set cookies by default.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Safari isn&#8217;t part of the &#8220;open web&#8221; because it doesn&#8217;t allow ad networks to track users across websites by default? Used to be that all major browsers allowed websites to create pop-up (and pop-under) windows for advertising; are browsers that block such pop-ups by default not part of the &#8220;open web&#8221; as well?</p>

<p>What I detect in Google&#8217;s behavior (and Battelle&#8217;s more-or-less defense of it) is a sense of entitlement. That because in the past ad networks could track almost all users via cookies, they are entitled to continue tracking almost all users across the web via cookies, even when a large (and growing) number of them begin using a web browser which, by default, tries to prevent it.</p>

<p>Arguing that Google didn&#8217;t do anything wrong &#8212; or all that wrong &#8212; is one thing. But trying to spin this into an argument that Apple has done something wrong, and that Google was just reacting naturally, is something else.</p>

<p>The same goes for Flash. Mobile Safari wasn&#8217;t the first browser to ship without support for Flash or other media plugins. What made Mobile Safari&#8217;s lack of Flash support controversial is that it was the first <em>popular</em> browser to ship without Flash support, and thus the first to disrupt the assumption that &#8220;almost all&#8221; browsers had Flash support.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2012-02-24"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en">
      <![CDATA[
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re starting to do some things differently,&#8221; Phil Schiller said to me.</p>

<p>We were sitting in a comfortable hotel suite in Manhattan just over a week ago. I&#8217;d been summoned a few days earlier by Apple PR with the offer of a private &#8220;product briefing&#8221;. I had no idea heading into the meeting what it was about. I had no idea how it would be conducted. This was new territory for me, and I think, for Apple.</p>

<p>I knew it wasn&#8217;t about the iPad 3 &#8212; that would get a full-force press event in California. Perhaps new retina display MacBooks, I thought. But that was just a wild guess, and it was wrong. It was about Mac OS X &#8212; or, as Apple now calls it almost everywhere, OS X. The meeting was structured and conducted very much like an Apple product announcement event. But instead of an auditorium with a stage and theater seating, it was simply with a couch, a chair, an iMac, and an Apple TV hooked up to a Sony HDTV. And instead of a room full of writers, journalists, and analysts, it was just me, Schiller, and two others from Apple &#8212; Brian Croll from product marketing and Bill Evans from PR. (From the outside, at least in my own experience, Apple&#8217;s product marketing and PR people are so well-coordinated that it&#8217;s hard to discern the difference between the two.)</p>

<p>Handshakes, a few pleasantries, good hot coffee, and then, well, then I got an Apple press event for one. Keynote slides that would have looked perfect had they been projected on stage at Moscone West or the Yerba Buena Center, but instead were shown on a big iMac on a coffee table in front of us. A presentation that started with the day&#8217;s focus (&#8220;We wanted you here today to talk about OS X&#8221;) and a review of the Mac&#8217;s success over the past few years (5.2 million Macs sold last quarter; 23 (soon to be 24) consecutive quarters of sales growth exceeding the overall PC industry; tremendous uptake among Mac users of the Mac App Store and the rapid adoption of Lion).</p>

<p>And then the reveal: Mac OS X &#8212; sorry, OS X &#8212; is going on an iOS-esque one-major-update-per-year development schedule. This year&#8217;s update is scheduled for release in the summer, and is ready <em>now</em> for a developer preview release. Its name is Mountain Lion.<sup id="fnr1-2012-02-16"><a href="#fn1-2012-02-16">1</a></sup></p>

<p>There are many new features, I&#8217;m told, but today they&#8217;re going to focus on telling me about ten of them. <em>This is just like an Apple event</em>, I keep thinking. Just like with Lion, Mountain Lion is evolving in the direction of the iPad. But, just as with Lion last year, it&#8217;s about sharing ideas and concepts with iOS, not sharing the exact same interaction design or code. The words &#8220;Windows&#8221; and &#8220;Microsoft&#8221; are never mentioned, but the insinuation is clear: Apple sees a fundamental difference between software for the keyboard-and-mouse-pointer Mac and that for the touchscreen iPad. Mountain Lion is not a step towards a single OS that powers both the Mac and iPad, but rather another in a series of steps toward defining a set of shared concepts, styles, and principles between two fundamentally distinct OSes.</p>

<p>Major new features</p>

<ul>
<li><p>iCloud, with an iOS-style easy signup process upon first turning on a new Mac or first logging into a new user account. Mountain Lion wants you to have an iCloud account.</p></li>
<li><p>iCloud document storage, and the biggest change to Open and Save dialog boxes in the 28-year history of the Mac. Mac App Store apps effectively have two modes for opening/saving documents: iCloud or the traditional local hierarchical file system. The traditional way is mostly unchanged from Lion (and, really, from all previous versions of Mac OS X). The iCloud way is visually distinctive: it looks like the iPad springboard &#8212; linen background, iOS-style one-level-only drag-one-on-top-of-another-to-create-one &#8220;folders&#8221;. It&#8217;s not a replacement of traditional Mac file management and organization. It&#8217;s a radically simplified alternative.</p></li>
<li><p>Apps have been renamed for cross-OS consistency. iChat is now Messages; iCal is now Calendar; Address Book is now Contacts. Missing apps have been added: Reminders and Notes look like Mac versions of their iOS counterparts. Now that these apps exist for the Mac, to-dos have been removed from Calendar and notes have been removed from Mail, leaving Calendar to simply handle calendaring and Mail to handle email.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The recurring theme: Apple is fighting against <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2002/11/cruft">cruft</a> &#8212; inconsistencies and oddities that have accumulated over the years, which made sense at one point but no longer &#8212; like managing to-dos in iCal (because CalDAV was being used to sync them to a server) or notes in Mail (because IMAP was the syncing back-end). The changes and additions in Mountain Lion are in a consistent vein: making things simpler and more obvious, closer to how things <em>should</em> be rather than simply how they always have been.</p>

<p>Schiller has no notes. He is every bit as articulate, precise, and rehearsed as he is for major on-stage events. He knows the slide deck stone cold. It strikes me that I have spoken in front of a thousand people but I&#8217;ve never been as well-prepared for a presentation as Schiller is for this one-on-one meeting. (Note to self: I should be that rehearsed.)</p>

<p>This is an awful lot of effort and attention in order to brief what I&#8217;m guessing is a list of a dozen or two writers and journalists. It&#8217;s Phil Schiller, spending an entire week on the East Coast, repeating this presentation over and over to a series of audiences of one. There was no less effort put into the preparation of this presentation than there would have been if it had been the WWDC keynote address.</p>

<p>What do I think so far, Schiller asks. It all seems rather obvious now that I&#8217;ve seen it &#8212; and I mean <em>obvious</em> in a good way. I remain convinced that iCloud is exactly what Steve Jobs said it was: the cornerstone of everything Apple does for the next decade. So of course it makes sense to bring iCloud to the Mac in a big way. Simplified document storage, iMessage, Notification Center<sup id="fnr2-2012-02-16"><a href="#fn2-2012-02-16">2</a></sup>, synced Notes and Reminders &#8212; all of these things are part of iCloud. It&#8217;s all a step toward making your Mac just another device managed in your iCloud account. Look at your iPad and think about the features it has that would work well, for a lot of people, if they were on the Mac. That&#8217;s Mountain Lion &#8212; and probably a good way to predict the future of the continuing parallel evolution of iOS and OS X.<sup id="fnr3-2012-02-16"><a href="#fn3-2012-02-16">3</a></sup></p>

<p>But <em>this</em>, I say, waving around at the room, this feels a little odd. I&#8217;m getting the presentation from an Apple announcement event without the event. I&#8217;ve already been told that I&#8217;ll be going home with an early developer preview release of Mountain Lion. I&#8217;ve never been at a meeting like this, and I&#8217;ve never heard of Apple seeding writers with an as-yet-unannounced major update to an operating system. Apple is not exactly known for sharing details of as-yet-unannounced products, even if only just one week in advance. Why not hold an event to announce Mountain Lion &#8212; or make the announcement on apple.com before talking to us?</p>

<p>That&#8217;s when Schiller tells me they&#8217;re doing some things differently now.</p>

<p>I wonder immediately about that &#8220;now&#8221;. I don&#8217;t press, because I find the question that immediately sprang to mind uncomfortable. And some things remain unchanged: Apple executives explain what they want to explain, and they explain nothing more.</p>

<p>My gut feeling though, is this. Apple didn&#8217;t want to hold an event to announce Mountain Lion because those press events are precious. They just used one for the iBooks/education thing, and they&#8217;re almost certainly on the cusp of holding a major one for the iPad. They don&#8217;t want to wait to release the Mountain Lion preview because they want to give Mac developers months of time to adopt new APIs and to help Apple shake out bugs. So: an announcement without an event. But they don&#8217;t want Mountain Lion to go unheralded. They are keenly aware that many observers suspect or at least worry that the Mac is on the wane, relegated to the sideline in favor of the new and sensationally popular iPad.</p>

<p>Thus, these private briefings. Not merely to explain what Mountain Lion is &#8212; that could just as easily be done with a website or PDF feature guide &#8212; but to convey that the Mac and OS X remain both important and the subject of the company&#8217;s attention. The move to a roughly annual release cycle, to me, suggests that Apple is attempting to prove itself a walk-and-chew-gum-at-the-same-time company. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070414112638/http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/070412/sfth056.html?.v=87">Remember this, five years ago</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>iPhone has already passed several of its required certification
tests and is on schedule to ship in late June as planned. We can&#8217;t
wait until customers get their hands (and fingers) on it and
experience what a revolutionary and magical product it is.
However, iPhone contains the most sophisticated software ever
shipped on a mobile device, and finishing it on time has not come
without a price &#8212; we had to borrow some key software engineering
and QA resources from our Mac OS X team, and as a result we will
not be able to release Leopard at our Worldwide Developers
Conference in early June as planned. While Leopard&#8217;s features will
be complete by then, we cannot deliver the quality release that we
and our customers expect from us. We now plan to show our
developers a near final version of Leopard at the conference, give
them a beta copy to take home so they can do their final testing,
and ship Leopard in October. We think it will be well worth the
wait. Life often presents tradeoffs, and in this case we&#8217;re sure
we&#8217;ve made the right ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Putting both iOS and OS X on an annual release schedule is a sign that Apple is confident it no longer needs to make such tradeoffs in engineering resources. There&#8217;s an aspect of Apple&#8217;s &#8220;now&#8221; &#8212; changes it needs to make, ways the company needs to adapt &#8212; that simply relate to just how damn big, and how successful, the company has become. They are in uncharted territory, success-wise. They are cognizant that they&#8217;re no longer the upstart, and are changing accordingly.</p>

<p>It seems important to Apple that the Mac not be perceived as an afterthought compared to the iPad, and, perhaps more importantly, that Apple not be perceived as itself considering or treating the Mac as an afterthought.</p>

<hr />

<p>I&#8217;ve been using Mountain Lion for a week, preinstalled on a MacBook Air loaned to me by Apple. I have little to report: it&#8217;s good, and I look forward to installing the developer preview on my own personal Air. It&#8217;s a preview, incomplete and with bugs, but it feels at least as solid as Lion did a year ago in its developer previews.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m interested to see how developer support for Mac App Store-only features plays out. Two big ones: iCloud document storage and Notification Center. Both of these are slated only for third-party apps from the Mac App Store. Many developers, though, have been maintaining non-Mac App Store versions of their apps. If this continues, such apps are going to lose feature parity between the App Store and non-App Store versions. Apple is not taking the Mac in iOS&#8217;s &#8220;all apps must come through the App Store&#8221; direction, but they&#8217;re certainly encouraging developers to go Mac App Store-only with iCloud features that are only available to Mac App Store apps (and, thus, which have gone through the App Store approval process).</p>

<p>My favorite Mountain Lion feature, though, is one that hardly even has a visible interface. Apple is calling it &#8220;Gatekeeper&#8221;. It&#8217;s a system whereby developers can sign up for free-of-charge Apple developer IDs which they can then use to cryptographically sign their applications. If an app is found to be malware, Apple can revoke that developer&#8217;s certificate, rendering the app (along with any others from the same developer) inert on any Mac where it&#8217;s been installed. In effect, it offers all the security benefits of the App Store, except for the process of approving apps by Apple. Users have three choices which type of apps can run on Mountain Lion:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only those from the App Store</li>
<li>Only those from the App Store or which are signed by a developer ID</li>
<li>Any app, whether signed or unsigned</li>
</ul>

<p>The default for this setting is, I say, exactly right: the one in the middle, disallowing only unsigned apps. This default setting benefits users by increasing practical security, and also benefits developers, preserving the freedom to ship whatever software they want for the Mac, with no approval process.</p>

<p>Call me nuts, but that&#8217;s one feature I hope will someday go in the other direction &#8212; from OS X to iOS.</p>

<p>As soon as Schiller told me the name, I silently cursed myself for not having predicted it. Apple is a company of patterns. iPhone 3G, followed by a same-form-factor-but-faster 3GS; iPhone 4 followed by a same-form-factor-but-faster 4S. Leopard followed by Snow Leopard; so, of course: Lion followed by Mountain Lion.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2012-02-16"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>

      <![CDATA[
<p>What is Apple at heart: a software company, or a hardware company?</p>

<p>This is a perennial question. The truth, of course, is that Apple is neither. Apple is an experience company. That they create both hardware and software is part of creating the entire product experience.</p>

<p>But, as a thought experiment, which is more important to you? What phone would you rather carry? An iPhone 4S modified to run Android or Windows Phone 7? Or a top-of-the-line HTC, Samsung, or Nokia handset running iOS 5?</p>

<p>What computer would you rather use? A MacBook running Windows 7, or, say, a Lenovo ThinkPad running Mac OS X 10.7?</p>

<p>For me, the answers are easy. It&#8217;s the software that matters most to me. I&#8217;d pick a Nokia Lumia running iOS 5 over an iPhone 4S running any other OS, and I&#8217;d pick the ThinkPad running Mac OS X over a Mac running Windows. No hesitation.</p>

<p>What do you think Steve Jobs would have chosen, facing the same choices?</p>

<p>Truth is he probably would have smashed any of such hypothetical devices against the nearest wall in a fit of rage, but, if forced to choose, I believe Jobs would have gone with the software.<sup id="fnr1-2012-02-14"><a href="#fn1-2012-02-14">1</a></sup> The hardware and the software are both important; Jobs clearly cared deeply about both. But I think Jobs ultimately thought software was more important. That was his whole explanation for the one-button design of the iPhone, on stage at Macworld Expo in January 2007, talking about the inherent problems with the existing smartphones then on the market. Jobs said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They all have these keyboards that are there whether you need them
or not to be there. And they all have these control buttons that
are fixed in plastic and are the same for every application. Well,
every application wants a slightly different user interface, a
slightly optimized set of buttons, just for it. And what happens
if you think of a great idea six months from now? You can’t run
around and add a button to these things. They’re already shipped.</p>

<p>So what do you do? It doesn’t work because the buttons and the
controls can’t change. They can’t change for each application, and
they can’t change down the road if you think of another great idea
you want to add to this product.</p>

<p>Well, how do you solve this?</p>

<p>Hmm. It turns out, we have solved it! We solved it in computers 20
years ago. We solved it with a bit-mapped screen that could
display anything we want. Put any user interface up. And a
pointing device. We solved it with the mouse. Right? We solved
this problem. So how are we going take this to a mobile device?</p>

<p>What we&#8217;re going to do is get rid of all these buttons and just make a
giant screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few minutes later, Jobs said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, you know, one of the pioneers of our industry, Alan Kay, has
had a lot of great quotes throughout the years. And I ran across
one of them recently that explains how we look at this. Explains
why we go about doing things the way we do, because we love
software.</p>

<p>And here’s the quote: “People who are really serious about
software should make their own hardware.”</p>

<p>You know, Alan said this 30 years ago, and this is how we feel
about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This design &#8212; getting rid of all those buttons and just making a giant screen &#8212; is today not only the ubiquitous standard for smartphones industry-wide, but also exactly describes another device you may have heard of, called the iPad.</p>

<h2>Design Is How It Works</h2>

<p>There is much that is wrong with Walter Isaacson&#8217;s biography of Jobs, but its treatment of software is the most profound of the book&#8217;s flaws. Isaacson doesn&#8217;t merely neglect or underemphasize Jobs&#8217;s passion for software and design, but he flat-out paints the opposite picture. </p>

<p>Isaacson makes it seem as though Jobs was almost solely interested in hardware, and even there, only in what the hardware <em>looked</em> like. Superficial aesthetics.</p>

<p>In Chapter 26, &#8220;Design Principles: The Studio of Jobs and Ive&#8221;, Isaacson writes (p. 344 in the hardcover print edition):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;Before Steve came back, engineers would say &#8216;Here are the guts&#8217;
&#8212; processor, hard drive &#8212; and then it would go to the designers
to put it in a box,&#8221; said Apple&#8217;s marketing chief Phil Schiller.
&#8220;When you do it that way, you come up with awful products.&#8221; But
when Jobs returned and forged his bond with Ive, the balance was
again tilted toward the designers. &#8220;Steve kept impressing on us
that the design was integral to what would make us great,&#8221; said
Schiller. &#8220;Design once again dictated the engineering, not just
vice versa.&#8221;</p>

<p>On occasion this could backfire, such as when Jobs and Ive
insisted on using a solid piece of brushed aluminum for the edge
of the iPhone 4 even when the engineers worried that it would
compromise the antenna. But usually the distinctiveness of its
designs &#8212; for the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad &#8212;
would set Apple apart and lead to its triumphs in the years after
Jobs returned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isaacson clearly believes that design is merely how a product looks and feels, and that &#8220;engineering&#8221; is how it actually works.</p>

<p>Jobs, in an interview with Rob Walker for his <a href="http://nytimes.com/2003/11/30/magazine/30IPOD.html?pagewanted=all">terrific 2003 New York Times Magazine profile on the creation of the iPod</a>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks
like. People think it’s this veneer &#8212; that the designers are
handed this box and told, ‘Make it look good!’ That’s not what we
think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like.
Design is how it works.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That quote is absent from Isaacson&#8217;s book, despite the book&#8217;s frequent use of existing source material. Instead, Isaacson includes an older quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That was the fundamental principle Jobs and Ive shared. Design was
not just about what a product looked like on the surface. It had
to reflect the product&#8217;s essence. &#8220;In most people&#8217;s vocabularies,
design means veneer,&#8221; Jobs told Fortune shortly after retaking the
reins at Apple. &#8220;But to me, nothing could be further from the
meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made
creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer
layers.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Jobs meant what he said to Fortune, and it&#8217;s an attempt to communicate the same core truth. But &#8220;Design is how it works&#8221; is a much better statement of Apple&#8217;s philosophy. Talk of a &#8220;product&#8217;s essence&#8221; (Isaacson&#8217;s words) or &#8220;the fundamental soul of a man-made creation&#8221; (Jobs&#8217;s) only serves to separate, conceptually, the art of design from the cold hard science of engineering. With just five words, &#8220;Design is how it works&#8221; expresses succinctly and accurately that engineering should and can be part of the art of design.</p>

<p>Design and engineering are, indeed, often in opposition &#8212; engineering constraints affect design; design goals affect engineering tradeoffs. But they are not separate endeavors. The philosophical question is which one is a subset of the other. What Schiller is telling Isaacson is that prior to Jobs&#8217;s return to Apple, design was what happened at the end of the engineering process. Post-Jobs, engineering became a component of the design process. This shift made all the difference in the world.</p>

<p>Isaacson does not understand this, and his telling of the Antennagate saga illustrates this perfectly. Again, the aforequoted bit from Chapter 26:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On occasion this could backfire, such as when Jobs and Ive
insisted on using a solid piece of brushed aluminum for the edge
of the iPhone 4 even when the engineers worried that it would
compromise the antenna. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The edge of the iPhone 4 (and now 4S) <em>is</em> the antenna.<sup id="fnr2-2012-02-14"><a href="#fn2-2012-02-14">2</a></sup> And it&#8217;s not made of brushed aluminum &#8212; it&#8217;s bead-blasted stainless steel.<sup id="fnr3-2012-02-14"><a href="#fn3-2012-02-14">3</a></sup> The engineering concern was therefore not that the steel edge would compromise the antennas, but rather that external antennas would compromise reception. The trade-off was that moving the antennas to the outside left more room on the inside &#8212; room for a bigger battery and other components, and allowed for the device to be thinner. Isaacson paints Jobs and Ive as being concerned only with how it looked and felt, with engineers left to worry about how it worked. The truth is that the design <em>was</em> how it worked.</p>

<p>Isaacson returns to this story in Chapter 39, in a section titled &#8220;Antennagate: Design vs. Engineering&#8221; (which section title again positions engineering as being <em>separate</em> from design, rather than <em>part</em> of design):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In many consumer product companies, there&#8217;s tension between the
designers, who want to make a product look beautiful, and the
engineers, who need to make sure it fulfills its functional
requirements. At Apple, where Jobs pushed both design and
engineering to the edge, that tension was even greater.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No passage in the book better illustrates Isaacson&#8217;s disregard for Steve Jobs&#8217;s philosophy of what &#8220;design&#8221; means.</p>

<h2>Serious About Software</h2>

<p>Isaacson, it seems clear, mistrusted Jobs. That&#8217;s good. But rather than using that mistrust to push back, to ask insightful questions, he instead simply turned to others. Regarding the early days of Apple and the original Mac, Isaacson turned to Andy Hertzfeld. The book does not suffer for this, because Hertzfeld is both honest and blessed with a seemingly extraordinary memory. But this history has been ably documented before &#8212; particularly well, no surprise, by Hertzfeld himself, with his <a href="http://www.folklore.org/">Folklore website</a> and the outstanding book compiled from that website, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0596007191/ref=nosim/daringfirebal-20">Revolution in the Valley</a></em>.</p>

<p>Far less documented are the subsequent stages of Jobs&#8217;s career: the NeXT years and his return to Apple. As a counterpart to Jobs for those years, Isaacson repeatedly turned to Bill Gates.</p>

<p>Isaacson refers many times throughout the book to Jobs&#8217;s famed &#8220;reality distortion field&#8221;. A search for the term in the iBooks edition returns 30 results, including the title of Chapter 11. In that chapter, Isaacson writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To some people, calling it a reality distortion field was just a
clever way to say that Jobs tended to lie. But it was in fact a
more complex form of dissembling. He would assert something &#8212; be
it a fact about world history or a recounting of who suggested an
idea at a meeting &#8212; without even considering the truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I.e., Jobs had the ability to make people believe whatever he said, whether it was true or not. But not everyone:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But Gates was one person who was resistant to Jobs&#8217;s reality
distortion field, and as a result he decided not to create
software tailored for the NeXT platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Isaacson viewed Jobs&#8217;s RDF as something very much akin to the Jedi mind trick &#8212; something that worked against most people, but not those with strong minds. That might even be true. But I think Isaacson was so concerned with himself being &#8220;resistant&#8221; that he chose to treat much of what Jobs told him as false.</p>

<p>Again, skepticism is good. But rather than do the research to verify Jobs&#8217;s version of events, to learn the facts so as to be able to dispute Jobs himself, he simply turned to sources he did trust, like Hertzfeld and Gates. But Gates is an odd choice to trust, because he clearly has a conflict of interest. His company competed against Jobs&#8217;s, and at a personal level, he is Jobs&#8217;s only rival in terms of historical stature in the industry.</p>

<p>What happens then, repeatedly, is that Jobs tells Isaacson something that is <em>true</em>, but Isaacson doesn&#8217;t believe it, and he then quotes someone else, like Bill Gates, saying something that is <em>false</em> to refute it, and Isaacson lets that remark stand as fact.</p>

<p>One example stands above all others. Chapter 23, &#8220;The Second Coming&#8221;, tells the tale of Apple&#8217;s 1996 acquisition of NeXT and Jobs&#8217;s return. For context, then-CEO Gil Amelio had decided that Apple needed to go outside the company for a successor to the classic Mac OS. The options: acquiring Be or NeXT, or licensing Sun&#8217;s Solaris or Microsoft&#8217;s Windows NT. (Licensing Windows NT was, according to Isaacson, what Amelio favored early on &#8212; which goes to show just how profoundly fucked Apple was at the time.) On page 302, Isaacson writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After informing Gassée that Apple was buying NeXT, Amelio had what
turned out to be an even more uncomfortable task: telling Bill
Gates. &#8220;He went into orbit,&#8221; Amelio recalled. Gates found it
ridiculous, but perhaps not surprising, that Jobs had pulled off
this coup. &#8220;Do you really think Steve Jobs has anything there?&#8221;
Gates asked Amelio. &#8220;I know this technology, it&#8217;s nothing but
warmed-over UNIX, and you&#8217;ll never be able to make it work on your
machines.&#8221; Gates, like Jobs, had a way of working himself up, and
he did so now: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand that Steve doesn&#8217;t know
anything about technology? He&#8217;s just a super salesman. I can&#8217;t
believe you&#8217;re making such a stupid decision. … He doesn&#8217;t know
anything about engineering, and 99% of what he says and thinks is
wrong. What the hell are you buying that garbage for?&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only thing interesting about this quote is that Gates was so utterly, astoundingly, completely wrong. <em>But Isaacson never points that out.</em></p>

<p>In Gates&#8217;s defense, the above anti-NeXT invective is attributed to him second-hand. Isaacson drew it from Gil Amelio&#8217;s <em>On the Firing Line</em>. But what Gates did say to Isaacson, in the present day, paints an even less accurate picture. The next paragraph in the book reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Years later, when I raised it with him, Gates did not recall being
that upset. The purchase of NeXT, he argued, did not really give
Apple a new operating system. &#8220;Amelio paid a lot for NeXT, and
let&#8217;s be frank, the NeXT OS was never really used.&#8221; Instead the
purchase ended up bringing in Avie Tevanian, who could help the
existing Apple operating system evolve so that it eventually
incorporated the kernel of the NeXT technology. Gates knew that
the deal was destined to bring Jobs back to power. &#8220;But that was a
twist of fate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What they ended up buying was a guy who
most people would not have predicted would be a great CEO, because
he didn&#8217;t have much experience at it, but he was a brilliant guy
with great design taste and great engineering taste. He suppressed
his craziness enough to get himself appointed interim CEO.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So ends this section of the chapter, with no additional commentary from Isaacson or any other sources. The above is simply left to stand as a description. A reader with no knowledge, who trusts Isaacson, would be left to believe that the above is an accurate description of Apple&#8217;s NeXT acquisition.</p>

<p>It is, in fact, completely and utterly wrong. NeXTStep was not &#8220;just warmed over UNIX&#8221;. Apple did get NeXT&#8217;s OS to run on Mac hardware. Mac OS X 10.0 was a hybrid of Mac and NeXT technology, but it was clearly the NeXT system with Mac technologies integrated, not the other way around. iOS &#8212; the system that powers both the iPhone and iPad &#8212; is a direct descendent of NeXTStep. Even the original iPod, which wasn&#8217;t based on NeXT technology, used the column-view concept for hierarchical navigation that NeXT pioneered.</p>

<p>Gates makes it sound as though Apple&#8217;s NeXT acquisition was effectively only a talent acquisition. It was in fact both a talent and technology acquisition, and what was then NeXT technology now serves as the basis for both Mac OS X and iOS.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s almost impossible to overstate just how wrong Bill Gates is here, but Isaacson presents Gates&#8217;s side as the truth. This is no small thing for Steve Jobs&#8217;s biographer to get wrong. Jobs&#8217;s career was long, rich, and varied, but if you wanted to reduce his entire life&#8217;s work to a nutshell, it would be exactly what Isaacson, channeling Gates, so completely misunderstood: the software system created by NeXT, which was then continuously expanded upon and refined by Apple.</p>

<p>NeXT&#8217;s software was what brought Jobs back to Apple. It saved the Mac platform, then <em>grew</em> the Mac platform. It serves today as the foundation of the iPhone and iPad. NeXT did struggle in the market, but their software was a long bet that ultimately paid off. Arguably it took 20 years for it to thrive, but Steve Jobs seemingly never lost faith or confidence in it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just that Isaacson was wrong about <em>something</em>; it&#8217;s that he was wrong about the most important thing in Jobs&#8217;s career. There&#8217;s a decades-long story arc about the software system started at NeXT that Isaacson completely misses.</p>

<hr />

<p>After reading about Jobs, it&#8217;s tempting to succumb to a Jobsian-style binary view of the world. Total shit, or the greatest thing ever; five stars, or zero stars. You can get fired up that way, and see my criticism here as condemning Isaacson&#8217;s book as total shit, zero stars. That would be a mistake. <em>Steve Jobs</em> is not literature, but it is a good book, but alas with several holes and egregious errors. </p>

<p>Isaacson includes that Alan Kay quote about serious software people making their own hardware, but doesn&#8217;t seem to heed it, or to recognize that it perfectly describes Steve Jobs&#8217;s career and explains the phenomenal success of Apple&#8217;s products.</p>

<p>Note that my complaints here are not about Isaacson being insufficiently deferential. That the book is not a hagiography is to its credit. The personal stuff &#8212; documentation of Jobs&#8217;s cruelty (and his <em>talent</em> for cruelty), his tantrums, his tendency to claim for himself the ideas of others &#8212; that’s not problematic. Isaacson handles that well, and what he reports in that regard jibes with everything we know about the man. My complaints are about outright technical inaccuracies, and getting the man’s <em>work</em> wrong. The design process, the resulting products, the centrality of software &#8212; Isaacson simply misses the boat.</p>

<p>You could learn more about Steve Jobs&#8217;s work by reading <a href="http://nytimes.com/2003/11/30/magazine/30IPOD.html?pagewanted=all">Rob Walker&#8217;s 2003 New York Times Magazine piece</a> than by reading Isaacson&#8217;s book, but even then we&#8217;re left wanting for the stories behind any of Apple&#8217;s products after the iPod. Isaacson&#8217;s book may well be the defining resource for Jobs&#8217;s personal life &#8212; his childhood, youth, eccentricities, cruelty, temper, and emotional outbursts. But as regards Jobs&#8217;s <em>work</em>, Isaacson leaves the reader profoundly and tragically misinformed.</p>

<p>Isaacson gives us the story of an asshole. But the world is full of assholes. What we need is the story of the one man who spearheaded so many remarkable products and who built an amazing and unique company.</p>

      <![CDATA[
<p>Adrian Kingsley-Hughes, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hardware/microsoft-gets-it-right-with-windows-8-on-arm-and-why-apple-should-be-worried/18071">regarding this week&#8217;s news about Windows for ARM</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And this is why Apple should be worried. So far I’ve been
concerned that WOA would offer a cut-down, Fisher Price sort of
Windows experience. It would look at a bit like duck, quack
something like a duck, but actually be more of a platypus than a
duck, and that ultimately this would be its undoing. But now I
realize that I was wrong. WOA looks like Windows, quacks like
Windows, and is Windows. Microsoft has pulled off what it
promised, and has taken its desktop OS and put it across multiple
platforms and onto various screen sizes. This changes how we look
at tablets.</p>

<p>Apple has maintained a gulf between the Mac OS and iOS on a number
of fronts. While we’re seeing some unification (in many ways
with the migration of iOS features into the Mac OS), you can’t
argue that there’s still a big chasm between the two platforms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a recurring theme. Someone does something different than Apple, has some success with it, and pundits like Kingsley-Hughes start arguing that Apple needs to change course and do what the other guys are doing. Exhibit A: the Kindle Fire. It&#8217;s selling well &#8212; nowhere near as well as the iPad, mind you, but it&#8217;s not collecting dust in warehouses like most other tablets are &#8212; prompting some to argue <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/apple_is_now_forced_to_build_a_7-inch_tablet/">that Apple &#8220;must&#8221; release a $250 7-inch tablet too</a>.</p>

<p>Now we have Microsoft taking a very different approach to managing the difference between traditional PCs and touchscreen tablets. They&#8217;re going with a &#8220;one OS for all devices&#8221; strategy; Apple chose a &#8220;different OSes with specific shared concepts for each type of device&#8221; strategy.</p>

<p>Good for Microsoft for choosing a different strategy. Good for Amazon for choosing a different strategy. Their possible successes, however, do not necessarily bode poorly for Apple. There is room in the market for very different devices.</p>

<p>That Microsoft&#8217;s approach appeals to some more than Apple&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t mean Apple needs to respond to it or follow their lead. The fact that the iPad does not run Mac OS X, nor run Mac apps, is by design &#8212; not a technical limitation. And the iPad&#8217;s success &#8212; it now sells at three times the rate of all Macs combined &#8212; suggests that consumers see the iPad&#8217;s differences as a benefit, not a limitation.</p>

<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean Microsoft (and Amazon, and everyone else) should copy Apple&#8217;s iPad strategy as closely as possible. But it certainly shows that Apple not only does not &#8220;need&#8221; to follow Microsoft&#8217;s or Amazon&#8217;s strategies, but that they shouldn&#8217;t. The iPad was not designed to be all things for all people. How much better would the iPad need to be selling to convince these pundits that Apple nailed it, that they struck gold with the iPad&#8217;s concept and execution? There may well be gold in other spots on the tablet frontier, but Apple is going to keep digging in the same spot.</p>

<p>Ed Bott, &#8220;<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/how-apple-is-sabotaging-an-open-standard-for-digital-books/4378">How Apple Is Sabotaging an Open Standard for Digital Books</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple’s behavior is a modern, sophisticated version of the
“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish">embrace, extend, and extinguish</a>” behavior that got
Microsoft in so much trouble in the 1990s: Enter a product
category supporting a widely used standard, extend that standard
with proprietary capabilities, and then use those differences to
disadvantage competitors. (The strategy is even more effective if
you have a dominant market position in another, related category
that you can use for leverage. Think Windows in the 1990s, iPad
in 2012.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with Bott that Apple is being competitive here, but disagree that it&#8217;s an example of embrace/extend/extinguish. Put another way, over the weekend <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/apples-mind-bogglingly-greedy-and-evil-license-agreement/4360">Bott called the iBooks Author  EULA &#8220;mind-bogglingly greedy and evil&#8221;</a>; I agree with the <em>greedy</em>, but not the <em>evil</em> or the mind-bogglingliness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So Apple, which claims to use the ePub format exclusively, has now
created an incompatible, proprietary version of that format. And
with iBooks Author they’ve added licensing terms that restrict
what an author can do with the generated content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why I disagree with the comparison to Microsoft&#8217;s embrace/extend/extinguish strategy: Apple isn&#8217;t calling the new iBooks Author format &#8220;ePub&#8221;. They never mentioned &#8220;ePub&#8221; during last week&#8217;s event. iBooks Author doesn&#8217;t use &#8220;ePub&#8221; anywhere in the user interface or documentation. The filename extension is &#8216;.ibooks&#8217;, not &#8216;.epub&#8217;. Arguing that Apple is following the embrace/extend/extinguish strategy implies that Apple was attempting to redefine &#8220;ePub&#8221; to mean &#8220;ePub plus Apple proprietary extensions&#8221;. Apple isn&#8217;t doing that. They&#8217;re very clearly presenting the output of iBooks Author as something new and proprietary to the iBooks Author.</p>

<p>Bott points to <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4059">this iBooks FAQ from Apple</a>, which states that the only formats supported by iBooks are industry-standard ePub and PDF. Given that the modification date on this FAQ is 22 December 2011, it seems clear that this is simply an outdated FAQ, not an attempt to describe the new iBooks format as ePub.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not trying to be cute here. I understand that technically, under the hood, the iBooks Author output is standard ePub plus Apple proprietary extensions. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to say that Apple is attempting to confuse anyone in this regard. The under-the-hood similarities to ePub are an implementation detail. No casual user creating a work in iBooks Author should have any reason to believe they are creating an ePub file, or something that can be used anywhere other than in the iBooks app on an iPad.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t disagree that Apple&#8217;s goal is for the proprietary iBooks format to become a de facto standard &#8212; for it to become popular and widely used and thus, because it only works on the iPad, further cement the iPad as the leading next-generation personal computing platform. I simply disagree that Apple is being in any way disingenuous or misleading about it. The only people who seem to be confused about iBooks Author&#8217;s relationship to ePub are technically-minded people who know exactly what ePub is and who have a vested interest in seeing the open standard become the de facto industry standard.</p>

<p>Bott writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They also could have included the option to import ePub files. As
a publisher and author myself, I would have welcomed that option.
I could create a book using the industry-leading standard ePub
format, for sale in any outlet, then import it into iBooks Author,
add interactive elements, and sell an enhanced version in the
iTunes Store for the same price.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What Bott is asking for here, to me, would have been a <em>more</em> embrace/extend/extinguish sort of move &#8212; to allow iBooks Author to open a cross-platform ePub book, make changes, and then save it in a proprietary format that can only be read in iBooks. It might have been a convenience to authors and publishers who already have ePub source files, but by not even allowing iBooks Author to import ePub, it only serves to emphasize that iBooks Author is not a general-purpose ePub or e-book tool. It is an iBooks tool.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple, which uses the ePub standard as the core for iBooks, could
easily have produced their free authoring tool so that it
continues to support what they acknowledge is the
“industry-leading standard.” The program could offer users a
choice of output formats: a standard ePub file or a fully
interactive iBooks file.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They could have, but they didn&#8217;t. And if they had, when exporting to standard ePub, the books would lose all of the formatting and interactive features that are exclusive to the iBooks format. Apple wants authors and publishers to use those features, because those features are what differentiates iBooks on the iPad from all other e-readers.</p>

<hr />

<p>Bott&#8217;s on firmer ground with this follow-up piece: &#8220;<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/some-standards-are-more-open-than-others/4394">Some Standards Are More Open Than Others</a>&#8221;, wherein he makes the case that Apple is a hypocrite for developing and promoting its own proprietary e-book format while serving as a member of the International Digital Publishing Forum, the trade group behind the ePub standard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OK, everyone, you got that? It’s just capitalism! Why should Apple
care about other companies in the digital publishing industry? Let
them go build their own tools and design their own formats!</p>

<p>Except for one little thing. Apple is a <a href="http://idpf.org/membership/members">member in good standing of
the International Digital Publishing Forum</a>, which identifies
itself as the “Trade and Standards Organization for the Digital
Publishing Industry.”</p>

<p>As a member of the IDPF, Apple most certainly is on record as
agreeing to do what Gruber thinks they don’t have to do: reduce
the cross-platform burdens of the entire digital publishing
industry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are an awful lot of companies on the IDPF members list, including at least a few that produce tools that generate digital publications in proprietary formats (e.g. Adobe and Quark, to name two that compete directly against iBooks Author).</p>

<p>On the one hand, iBooks, since its inception, has had best-of-breed support for the ePub standard, and all the regular books available for download and purchase through the iBookstore (i.e. every book other than the dozen or so made using iBooks Author which appeared in the store last week) are in standard ePub format. (Apple even requires books submitted to the store to pass ePub standard validation tests.) And Apple has made no mention of moving away from this support for ePub.</p>

<p>The question is, what does it mean to be a &#8220;good&#8221; member of IDPF: supporting ePub alongside any proprietary formats, or supporting ePub to the exclusion of any proprietary formats? Bott clearly sees it as the latter.</p>

<p>Put another way, if you&#8217;re a producer of ePub-formatted books and wish to remain so, your books are just as welcome in the iBookstore and just as well-rendered in iBooks as they were prior to Apple&#8217;s announcements last week.</p>

<p>To me, again, it&#8217;s like mobile web apps versus native apps on the iPhone. When the iPhone debuted in 2007, Apple declared that <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/06/wwdc_2007_keynote">the only way for third-party developers to write software for it</a> was to write mobile web apps. Such mobile web apps were far more capable than mobile web apps on any other platform &#8212; but they were far <em>less</em> capable than the native Cocoa Touch apps Apple provided with the iPhone. In 2008, when Apple unveiled the App Store and native Cocoa Touch SDK, it didn&#8217;t drop support for mobile web apps. Indeed, mobile web app support in iOS has continued to improve, and today still exceeds the mobile web app support in any other OS. But the fact that mobile web apps on iOS remain far less capable than native App Store apps paints Apple as &#8220;anti-web&#8221; in the eyes of some critics.</p>

<p>I believe the new iBooks Author format is to iBooks as native App Store apps are to the iPhone, and that ePub is to iBooks as mobile web apps are to the iPhone: closed/proprietary/technically-superior/better-looking on one side, open/standard/cross-platform on the other side. I expect Apple to continue to support ePub the same way it has continued to support mobile web apps &#8212; as a second-class citizen compared to its own proprietary format, but still just as good as, if not better than, anyone else in the industry.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know enough about the collective politics of the IDPF to say whether this stance is contrary to the group&#8217;s goals or mores. If you see the goal of ePub as serving as an expressive, standard, cross-platform format for e-books, Apple remains fully on board with that. If you see the goal of ePub as serving as the <em>only</em> commercial e-book format &#8212; i.e. that all e-books should be cross-platform &#8212; I don&#8217;t see how you can argue that Apple was ever on board with that. There&#8217;s a big difference between arguing &#8220;<em>There should be a good standard for cross-platform books</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>All books should be based on a good cross-platform standard</em>&#8221;.</p>

<hr />

<p>Lastly, Bott thinks I&#8217;ve slowly changed my mind over the last few days:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The top defender is ace Apple-watcher John Gruber, who has been
slowly and publicly changing his mind on the new iBooks format and
accompanying license agreement over the past few days. First he
said it was “<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/01/19/ibooks-author-eula">Apple at its worst</a>.” And then he began backtracking.</p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/01/19/unprecedented">First</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The output of iBooks Author is, as far as I can tell, HTML5 &#8212;
pretty much ePub 3 with whatever nonstandard liberties Apple saw
fit to take in order to achieve the results they wanted. It’s
not a standard format in the sense of following a spec from a
standards body like the W3C…</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/01/ibooks_author_file_format">Next</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple’s concern is not what’s best for the publishing industry,
and it certainly isn’t about what’s best for the makers of (and
users of) rival e-book reading devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/01/23/glazman-responds">And most recently</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But again, Apple’s not in this game to reduce the cross-platform
burdens of the publishing industry. If the publishing industry
wants to reduce the number of formats it supports and the hassles
of converting from one format to another, Apple’s pitch would be
to go exclusive to the iBookstore.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two separate issues in play. First is the iBooks Author EULA, and its requirement that if you sell a book generated by the app, you must do so exclusively through the iBookstore. Second is the proprietary file format of the new iBooks Author and its relationship to ePub 3.</p>

<p>My &#8220;this is Apple at its worst&#8221; remark was regarding the EULA. That criticism still stands. I believe Apple should treat the output of iBooks Author as it does Mac apps: allow authors and publishers to choose to sell them through the iBookstore and/or to sell them on their own. I could even see Apple requiring books made with iBooks Author to be submitted to the iBookstore if they&#8217;re going to be made available for sale anywhere &#8212; just remove the exclusivity clause. I see no reason why the iBookstore would not succeed in the same way the Mac App Store has. I say this is Apple at its worst because Apple has chosen the path of exerting the most control.<sup id="fnr1-2012-01-24"><a href="#fn1-2012-01-24">1</a></sup> A little more flexibility on Apple&#8217;s part would do well for everyone, even Apple itself, as it would only further encourage the use of iBooks Author.</p>

<p>The other remarks of mine that Bott quotes are regarding the second issue &#8212; the <em>proprietary file format versus ePub</em> one &#8212; and my stance on that is largely unchanged. The only thing I believe I was wrong about is my initial conjecture that the output of iBooks Author is mostly or entirely expressed in HTML5. It is indeed largely based on ePub (and thus HTML5), <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/01/23/ibooks-bjarnason">but significant aspects are not</a>. Here&#8217;s another snippet from my first piece Bott quotes from above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not a standard format in the sense of following a spec from a
standards body like the W3C, but it’s just HTML5 rendered by
WebKit &#8212; not a binary blob tied to iOS or Cocoa. It may not be
easy, but I don’t think it would be <em>that</em> much work for anyone
else with an ePub reader that’s based on WebKit to add support for
these iBooks textbooks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I no longer believe that to be true. I think it would take significant effort for a competitor to render the output of iBooks Author with full or even near-full fidelity. All the more reason for Apple to remove or loosen the exclusivity clause of the EULA.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1-2012-01-24">
<p>Actually, I take that back. Exerting the most control, they would disallow the free distribution of books generated with iBooks Author, and make it more like the iOS App Store. But such a restriction would completely contradict the role iBooks Author is intended to play with the new iTunes U, where individual teachers and professors are encouraged to use iBooks Author to produce their own courseware. What Apple has chosen is the path of exerting the most control while still supporting the new iTunes U.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2012-01-24"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>

      <![CDATA[
<p>Daniel Glazman, co-chairman of the W3C CSS Working Group, <a href="http://www.glazman.org/weblog/dotclear/index.php?post/2012/01/20/iBooks-Author-a-nice-tool-but">has a detailed technical analysis of the iBooks Author file format</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iba format clearly extends CSS (and therefore EPUB3) to offer
the following features:</p>

<ol>
<li>Template-based layout including special areas (gutter)</li>
<li>Extended underlining</li>
<li>Ability to control the size of each column and column gap in a
multi-column layout</li>
<li>Something equivalent to Adobe&#8217;s Regions and Exclusions.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>He thinks these nonstandard extensions are a strategic mistake on Apple&#8217;s part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a piece of software is so well designed from a UI point of
view and could become such an attractor in terms of usage, I feel
this is a totally wrong strategy. Opening up everything and using
only carefully chosen standards and matching the version of WebKit
used by Safari would have given an immense and almost unbeatable
competitive advantage to Apple, would have attracted even more
people to the Mac platform and would have turned the iBooks Store
into the primary online choice of publication for all new books.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It should surprise no one that the co-chair of a W3C working group deems standards compliance to be more important than does Apple. And he may well be right that it will prove to be a strategic mistake. But it&#8217;s worth noting that the e-book market leader, Amazon&#8217;s Kindle, uses a proprietary format. Eschewing ePub and any sort of standards compliance doesn&#8217;t seem to have hurt Amazon. And, up until yesterday, the only e-book format supported by iBooks has been standards compliant ePub, and that hasn&#8217;t made Apple the market leader. It&#8217;s a small sample size and we&#8217;re early in the game, but the evidence to date suggests the opposite of what Glazman is arguing. Kindle, with its proprietary file formats, is more popular than iBooks, which has been based on ePub.</p>

<p>Nor is Apple claiming this new format <em>is</em> ePub. They haven&#8217;t asserted proprietary new features or syntax for ePub the way, say, Netscape and Internet Explorer asserted proprietary new tags and features for HTML. The output of iBooks Author is no more intended to be an industry standard than are any other Apple-proprietary document formats &#8212; Pages, Numbers, Keynote, etc. This is Apple&#8217;s own e-book format, intended only to be displayed (played?) using Apple&#8217;s own software running on Apple&#8217;s own devices.</p>

<p>As with the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/01/19/unprecedented">end-user licensing kerfuffle</a>, it&#8217;s worth noting that the app&#8217;s name is <em>iBooks</em> Author, not <em>eBooks</em> Author. Just because there&#8217;s demand for an open-standards-based e-book production and layout tool of the scope and caliber of iBooks Author, doesn&#8217;t mean Apple has any interest in making such a tool.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Starting with full conformance with EPUB3 and pushing for a fast
update of EPUB3 or release of EPUB4 including all new CSS cool
kids was a much better, and much more secure way of doing things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if Apple had taken this route, the books generated by iBooks Author <em>today</em> wouldn&#8217;t have any of the layout features Glazman cited above. The iBooks format isn&#8217;t different just for the sake of being different; it&#8217;s different for the sake of being better &#8212; not better in the future, after a W3C review period and approval, but better <em>today</em>, in the textbooks you can download and read in iBooks right now.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the difference between &#8220;<em>What&#8217;s the best we can do within the constraints of the current ePub spec?</em>&#8221; versus &#8220;<em>What&#8217;s the best we can do given the constraints of our engineering talent?</em>&#8221; &#8212; the difference between going as fast as the W3C standards body permits versus going as fast as Apple is capable. </p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s concern is not what&#8217;s best for the publishing industry, and it certainly isn&#8217;t about what&#8217;s best for the makers of (and users of) rival e-book reading devices.</p>

<p>In some sense this is like a rehash of the App Store debate &#8212; iBooks Author is a developer tool for the iBooks platform. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/05/nack_control">As I&#8217;ve said regarding the App Store</a>, Apple&#8217;s priorities are as follows: Apple&#8217;s best interests first, users&#8217; second, developers&#8217; third. In this case the developers are the producers of commercial e-books, who must now choose between (a) going iBooks-exclusive; (b) figuring out a way to work iBooks Author into a cross-platform production workflow; or (c) eschewing iBooks Author entirely and using whatever other tools are out there, missing out on all the new iBooks-exclusive layout and design features.</p>

<p>If they go iBooks-exclusive, you can see how Apple would love that.</p>

<p>If they choose to work iBooks Author into their cross-platform production workflow, and it proves to be a pain in the ass, that&#8217;s not Apple&#8217;s problem.</p>

<p>If they eschew the use of iBooks Author altogether and suffer using worse-designed and less-capable tools, that&#8217;s not Apple&#8217;s problem. And if the book they produce based on these lesser tools and technologies doesn&#8217;t sell as well because it doesn&#8217;t offer the attractive and fun layout and design features available using iBooks Author, <em>that&#8217;s</em> not Apple&#8217;s problem either.</p>

<p>(What would be Apple&#8217;s problem is if iBooks&#8217;s new layout and design features do not prove to be a competitive advantage in the e-book market. But even then, Apple would merely be right back where they were prior to yesterday&#8217;s announcements.<sup id="fnr1-2012-01-20"><a href="#fn1-2012-01-20">1</a></sup>)</p>

<p>Glazman looks at these new iBooks books and sees a nonstandard proprietary format. Apple looks at these new iBooks and sees layouts and design features that no other e-book platform offers today. One man&#8217;s <em>nonstandard</em> is another man&#8217;s <em>competitive differentiation</em>.</p>

<p>iBooks still offers full support for the open standard ePub format. So as a loose analogy, I see ePub being as to the new iBooks format as mobile web apps are to native iOS App Store apps &#8212; one is an open industry standard fully supported by Apple, the other a closed proprietary platform with superior creation tools and end-user experience, which if you want to use, you must use on Apple&#8217;s terms. </p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1-2012-01-20">
<p>Another possible problem for Apple resulting from its decision to restrict iBooks Author as a tool only for the iBooks platform: resentment from publishers and authors who see this restriction as spiteful and greedy, not as strategic or competitive. Again though, that&#8217;s just a replay of the risks Apple took with its restrictive App Store policies.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2012-01-20"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
